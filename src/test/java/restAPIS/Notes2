Authentication: API verifies our identity (e.g., via token, API key, username/password)
Example: Logging in with username & password

Authorization: API checks if we are allowed to perform the action (e.g., access /admin, delete a user).
Example: Checking if a logged-in user can access admin features

Types of Authentication supported by rest assured:-
Basic Authentication, Digest Authentication,OAuth 1.0,OAuth 2.0, No Authentication,Api key, preemptive,bearer token etc

Basic Auth: Follows a challenge-response flow. The first request is sent without credentials, the server responds with a 401 Unauthorized, 
and then the client retries with credentials.

Preemptive Basic Auth: Skips the round trip. Credentials are sent immediately with the first request, avoiding the 401 challenge.

Digest Auth: More secure — instead of sending credentials directly, it sends a hashed value using the username, password, and a random nonce 
provided by the server. This helps prevent credentials from being intercepted.

----------------------basic vs preemptive--------------------
According to the HTTP protocol spec, Basic Authentication is designed to be a challenge-response mechanism.

Some servers are strictly configured to only respond to 401 challenges — they won’t accept preemptive credentials because:
They want to enforce that flow.
They're built on frameworks or middleware that expect it.
They might be tracking auth attempts for security auditing.

So in such cases, you have to go with the round trip(basic) — even if it's inefficient.

--------------------Bearer Token---------------
Bearer Token authentication is a form of token-based authentication, commonly used in modern APIs, especially with OAuth 2.0.
We pass bearer token in headers not in auth directly.

---------------------------How It Works:-----------
First,we or client authenticate ourself (e.g., using credentials, API key, or OAuth flow) and receives a token from the server.
Then we send the token in every request using the Authorization header.
The server validates the token,not the credentials directly and allows or denies access based on its validity and permissions (scopes).
It’s stateless — no need to re-authenticate with every request.

---------------oauth 1.0&2.0----------
> OAuth 1.0 is a legacy protocol which uses a signature-based approach where each request is cryptographically signed using HMAC-SHA1 and requires four credentials: 
consumer key, consumer secret, access token, and token secret. While secure, it’s quite complex and difficult to manage.

> OAuth 2.0 introduced a more flexible and developer-friendly model. It uses a single Bearer token, reduces complexity, and supports multiple flows 
like Authorization Code, Client Credentials, and Password Grant. Although it doesn’t sign each request, it relies on HTTPS for transport security. 
It’s now the standard for most modern APIs including Google, Microsoft, and Facebook.

-----------API KEY------------------
An API key is a unique alphanumeric string issued by an API provider to identify and authenticate the client making requests to the API.
We pass api key in headers or query params not in auth directly.

The auth() method is designed to support standard authentication protocols with well-defined flows, such as:
Basic Authentication (username & password),Digest Authentication, OAuth 1.0 and OAuth 2.0 etc

API keys are simple tokens that APIs expect directly in headers or query parameters.
There’s no formal authentication flow or protocol around API keys for Rest Assured to handle.


In Rest Assured, the Faker library is commonly used to generate dynamic, random test data (like names, emails, phone numbers) 
when sending API requests. This helps avoid hardcoded values and ensures better test coverage by using unique data 
for each test run.

I create a token utility class to generate and store tokens. While making API calls, if the response status is 401,
 I regenerate the token and retry the request automatically
