---------------------Api Chaining---------------------

API chaining is the process where the response from one API request is used as the input or parameter for another API request. 
It enables sequential execution of API calls that depend on each other's data.

Example Chain Structure:-
CreateUser → GetUser → UpdateUser → DeleteUser
Each step depends on data (e.g., user ID) returned from the previous one.

Approach 1: Single-Class Implementation

All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) are implemented within a single class (e.g., ApiChaining.java).
The CreateUser method retrieves a response (like a user ID).
That ID is stored and reused directly in other methods (e.g., GetUser, UpdateUser,DeleteUser).

Approach 2: Multi-Class with ITestContext
Each CRUD operation is written in a separate class.
Shared data (like user ID) is passed between classes using the ITestContext interface:
setAttribute() is used in one class to store data.
getAttribute() is used in another class to retrieve it.

Since the test methods are spread across multiple classes and depend on each other, they cannot be run individually by default.
Solution: Use a TestNG XML file to control execution order.

Running Tests with XML Configuration
To run dependent test classes in sequence, define them within a single <test> tag in the XML.
To allow running classes independently: Use separate <test> tags for each class, Use getSuite().setAttribute() to share data 
at the suite level, ensuring accessibility across all <test> tags.

API chaining can also be used to share common variables (e.g., bearer tokens) across multiple tests.
Promotes modularity, reusability, and cleaner test design, especially in complex test automation frameworks.

--------------------------Challenges faced while api testing---------------


1. Incorrect Parameter Mapping – Employee ID vs Mobile Number

During the integration of third-party APIs into our application, I was responsible for testing the functionality.
According to the Swagger documentation, all APIs were supposed to fetch data using the employee ID. 
But during testing, some APIs returned a 200 response with no data. After debugging, I found they were internally 
mapped to mobile number instead of employee ID. I documented the issue, validated with additional tests, and 
coordinated with the dev team and API provider. They later confirmed the mapping inconsistency and fixed it.

2.Security Issue – Login Using GET Method

The login API was using a GET method with username and password in the query parameters. This exposed sensitive 
information in the URL and logs. I immediately raised it as a critical security concern, and the provider switched 
it to a POST method to secure the credentials in the request body.
