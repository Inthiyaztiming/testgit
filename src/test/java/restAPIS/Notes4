RequestSpecification and ResponseSpecification are used to reduce boilerplate code by defining common request 
and response configurations such as base URI, headers, authentication, content type, and expected status codes 
in one central place.

Both RequestSpecification and ResponseSpecification are interfaces, so they cannot be instantiated directly. 
Instead, Rest Assured provides RequestSpecBuilder and ResponseSpecBuilder, which are concrete builder classes
 used to construct these specifications.

The build() method is mandatory because it converts the builder configuration into an actual RequestSpecification 
or ResponseSpecification object that Rest Assured can execute. Without calling build(), we only have a builder 
object, not a usable specification.

Internally, Rest Assured converts this configuration into an immutable specification that can be reused 
across multiple tests.
